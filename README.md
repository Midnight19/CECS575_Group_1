# Online-Bookstore-Management_CECS-575_Group-1
The Online Bookstore Project is a Java-based application designed to automate the book purchase process at bookstores. The goal of this project is to create a secure and efficient online book-selling platform. This bookshop application benefits both the customer and the shop owner since it assists both. It saves the buyer's time by allowing them to access the bookshop from anywhere. The suggested web program keeps track of sold and stock books in the database automatically. Customers can shop online for books at the Online Book Store using a web browser. A consumer may create an account, sign in, add products to a shopping cart. When compared to a regular user, the Administrator will have more features. The admin could add, delete, and edit book details, book categories, and member information, as well as confirm an order. The website will keep track of purchase history and order details. The online store also provides a feature of return policy on books in case of damaged or normal return as well. In order to implement the various features, we are planning to use multiple design patterns.
